Hi there I'm Shruti a third-year electronics undergrad.

This repository📝is all about the fronted projects I build while learning frontend development, most of them are made with the help of youtube or online resources
will link the resource with the project itself.

If you are just getting started with front-end development, try making all these projects to enhance your skills.

If you ❤ this repository📝, don't forget to ⭐ it.

NOTE: If you see any mistake, bring it up in the discussion or create a pull request.
